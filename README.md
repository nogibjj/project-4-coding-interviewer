# Serverless GPT Coding Interviewer

Endpoint: https://dukemsec-coding-interviewer.hf.space/

## Intro
Welcome to the readme for the Serverless GPT Coding Interviewer project! This project is a serverless GPT-empowered coding interviewer chatbot that analyzes users' code and asks questions about time and space complexity, and related follow-up questions. The chatbot is deployed in Hugging Face Spaces, which makes deployment super easy and highly recommended.
- Built a serverless GPT-empowered coding interviewer chatbot, whe the interviewer can analyze users' code and ask questions for users about time and space complexity, and related follow-up questions. 

## Getting Started
To get started with the Serverless GPT Coding Interviewer, simply visit the endpoint URL provided above (https://dukemsec-coding-interviewer.hf.space/). This will take you to the chatbot interface where you can begin interacting with the chatbot.

## Usage
To use the Serverless GPT Coding Interviewer, simply enter your code into the chatbot interface. The chatbot will then analyze your code and ask you questions about its time and space complexity, as well as any related follow-up questions. You can respond to the chatbot's questions and continue the conversation until you feel that you have received a thorough analysis of your code.



## Deployment
The Serverless GPT Coding Interviewer is deployed in Hugging Face Spaces, which makes deployment super easy and highly recommended. If you would like to deploy your own version of the chatbot, you can follow the instructions provided in the Hugging Face Spaces documentation.
